=======================

Steam Community city data in JSON format. [Steam Community](http://steamcommunity.com) is a great social network for gamers. It's also a very good network to base your social projects on.

Unfortunately, the API is not one of the best. While it's [documented well](http://steamcommunity.com/dev) for the most part, it still lacks in some figurative data.

One of this data is [information about players' locations](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetPlayerSummaries_.28v0001.29). It's presented in a form of three keys:

    "loccountrycode"=>"PL",
    "locstatecode"=>"86",
    "loccityid"=>35924

which corresponds to... Yeah, exactly what? We know `PL` stands for Poland, but what about `"86"`? What about `35924`?

Notice how inconsistent this data is:

1. State code always is returned as a stringified number. Very rarely it corresponds to something like `"M3"` (it happens, though)
2. Location city ID is just that. It's just an ID of a city. No indication what city, where, nothing, just a plain number

Solution
========

Well, I've devised a solution. I've scraped all the information about countries, states and cities and provided it in a simple JSON, machine-readable file, so you can check people's location on your own!

The file is available in the repository and, obviously, free and open-source.

Installation and usage
======================

    gem install steam_location

or add to `Gemfile`

    gem "steam_location", "~> 0.1.0"

Quick tutorial (for IRB):

    > require 'steam_location'
    > location = {"loccountrycode"=>"PL", "locstatecode"=>"86", "loccityid"=>35924}
    > SteamLocation.find(location)
     => {:loccountry=>"Poland", :locstate=>"Wielkopolskie", :loccity=>"Poznan", :map_search_string=>"Poznan, Wielkopolskie, Poland"}
    > SteamLocation.find("PL", "86", 35924)
     => {:loccountry=>"Poland", :locstate=>"Wielkopolskie", :loccity=>"Poznan", :map_search_string=>"Poznan, Wielkopolskie, Poland"}

The `location` hash in the example is an actual part of Steam Web API response for [`GetPlayerSummaries`](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetPlayerSummaries_.28v0002.29) call. You can simply pass player info hash to `SteamLocation.find` method, and it'll return information about player location.

You can use `:map_search_string` for map search queries, like asking Google Maps or Microsoft Bing or whatever mapping system you want to use.

This gem has been tested against Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3.
